Clone it recursively to download our datasets and trained models in your Jetson mini-computer

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/emmerich-research/Pleese.git`


Next we need to setup all the dependencies with this command
```
chmod +x buildall.sh run.sh
./buildall.sh
```
you need to enter your Jetson password for sudo access

run it with 
```
./run.sh
```
or
```
sudo python3 plastic-detection.py`
```
is normal if it takes longer time at first run
